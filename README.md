# quantum_heat_engine_simulator
The Quantum Heat Engine Simulator models a quantum heat engine using the QuTiP library. It takes input parameters (energy levels, coupling strengths, and temperatures) to simulate system dynamics, calculating energy changes and efficiency. This virtual experiment helps analyze performance under various conditions without a physical setup.
